# Topic: MVC Pattern for AutoHotkey GUIs

## Category

Pattern

## Overview

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a powerful architectural design pattern that separates concerns in GUI applications into three interconnected components. In AutoHotkey v2, implementing MVC helps create more maintainable, extensible, and testable GUI applications by properly separating data, presentation, and application logic.

## Key Points

- Model: Manages data, logic, and rules of the application, independent of the user interface
- View: Handles the visual representation of data and user interaction elements
- Controller: Acts as an intermediary between Model and View, handling user input and updating both as needed
- Using MVC results in more modular, testable, and maintainable code
- Event handlers in the Controller bind View events to Model operations

## Syntax and Parameters

```cpp
; Basic MVC application structure
MyMVCApp := MVCExampleApp()

class MVCExampleApp {
    __New() {
        this.model := MVCModel()
        this.view := MVCView()
        this.controller := MVCController(this.model, this.view)
        this.view.Show()
    }
}
```

## Code Examples

```cpp
class MVCModel {
    __New() {
        this.data := Map("count", 0)
    }
    
    IncrementCount() {
        this.data["count"]++
        return this.data["count"]
    }
    
    GetCount() {
        return this.data["count"]
    }
}

class MVCView {
    __New() {
        this.gui := Gui("+Resize", "MVC Example")
        this.gui.SetFont("s10")
        this.counterText := this.gui.AddText("w200 h30", "Count: 0")
        this.incrementButton := this.gui.AddButton("w200", "Increment")
        this.onIncrementHandler := ""
    }
    
    UpdateCounter(count) {
        this.counterText.Value := "Count: " count
    }
    
    SetIncrementHandler(handler) {
        this.onIncrementHandler := handler
        this.incrementButton.OnEvent("Click", this.onIncrementHandler)
    }
    
    Show() {
        this.gui.Show()
    }
}

class MVCController {
    __New(model, view) {
        this.model := model
        this.view := view
        
        this.view.SetIncrementHandler(this.HandleIncrement.Bind(this))
    }
    
    HandleIncrement(*) {
        newCount := this.model.IncrementCount()
        this.view.UpdateCounter(newCount)
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

- The Model should have no knowledge of the View or Controller
- The View should only display information and capture user interaction, with minimal business logic
- The Controller should connect the View's events to the Model's methods
- Use dependency injection to pass the Model and View to the Controller
- For more complex applications, consider implementing observable patterns for data binding
- Store all state in the Model, not in the View or Controller
- The View should expose methods for the Controller to update the UI based on Model changes

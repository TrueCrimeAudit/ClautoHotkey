Okay, let's analyze how to apply the advanced prompting techniques to improve this AHK v2 coding agent's system prompt. The current system prompt is already quite detailed, outlining coding standards, response workflows, and examples. The goal is to integrate the "interesting and not well-known" techniques, making the agent more robust, adaptable, and insightful.

Here's a breakdown, technique by technique, with specific integrations into the existing system prompt:

1. Dynamic XML Schema Generation (for Problem Solving Workflow):

Integration Point: Modify the <response_workflow> section.

Change: Before the 1. <understand> step, insert a new step: 0. <schema_design>.

New Prompt Text (within <schema_design>):

<schema_design>
  Based on the user's request (which will be provided in the next prompt), generate an XML schema that defines the optimal problem-solving workflow for *this specific type of AHK v2 task*.  This schema should include elements for:
    - Requirement analysis (including identifying relevant AHK commands and libraries)
    - Design (consider multiple approaches if appropriate, including class structures, data structures, and event handling)
    - Implementation (following the defined coding standards)
    - Verification (including generating test cases and predicting outcomes, focusing on AHK-specific error conditions like invalid variable names, incorrect function parameters, or GUI control issues)
    - Optimization (consider both performance and code clarity within the AHK context)

  The schema should be self-contained and specific to the task.  Justify the elements you include based on the anticipated problem type. *Then*, use this self-generated schema to guide your subsequent response.  Output only the XML schema in this step.
</schema_design>


Example Integration (Conceptual): If the user asks for a GUI with a listbox and a button, the generated XML might look something like (simplified):

<workflow>
  <requirements>
    <gui_elements>
      <listbox/>
      <button/>
    </gui_elements>
    <event_handling>
      <button_click/>
    </event_handling>
  </requirements>
  <design>
    <class_structure name="MyGui"/>
    <data_structures>
      <listbox_items type="array"/>
    </data_structures>
  </design>
  <implementation>
     ...
  </implementation>
  <verification>
    <test_cases>
      <add_item_to_listbox/>
      <click_button/>
      <verify_gui_display/>
    </test_cases>
  </verification>
</workflow>

Impact: This forces the agent to think about the best approach before diving into code. It makes the process adaptable to different AHK tasks.

2. Semantic Version Control Simulation:

Integration Point: Add a new section: <version_control>.

New Prompt Text (within <version_control>):

<version_control>
  You are managing a code repository for AHK v2 scripts.  Every time you provide code, treat it as a new version.  Use the following tagging system:

  `<code_version tag="[function_or_class_name]_[major].[minor].[patch]" impact="[brief description of the impact of changes]" diff="[previous_tag_or_none]" affected="[list_of_affected_use_cases_or_functions]">`

  - **`tag`:**  Follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch).  *Justify* your versioning choices:
      - **Major:** Incompatible API changes (e.g., changing class names, function signatures, or core data structures).
      - **Minor:**  Adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner (e.g., adding new methods, optional parameters, or GUI controls).
      - **Patch:** Backward-compatible bug fixes (e.g., correcting errors in logic, handling edge cases, improving error messages).
  - **`impact`:** Describe the *behavioral* changes, not just the code differences.  Explain *why* the code was changed from the user's perspective.
  - **`diff`:**  Refer to the previous version's tag (if applicable).  If this is the first version, use "none".
  - **`affected`:** List any other functions, classes, or use cases that might be affected by this change.

  Example:
  `<code_version tag="MyGuiClass_1.2.1" impact="Fixed a bug where the listbox wouldn't update correctly after adding an item.  This improves the user experience for dynamic lists." diff="MyGuiClass_1.2.0" affected="add_item_function">`

  Always include this tag *before* the code in your `<solution>` section.
</version_control>

Impact: Creates a history of code changes that's meaningful and helps track the evolution of the solution. This is particularly useful for debugging and understanding design choices.

3. Counterfactual Reasoning and Hypothetical AHK Interpreter:

Integration Point: Modify the <thinking> section within <response_workflow>.

Change: Add a new bullet point under "Identify potential issues or edge cases":

New Prompt Text (within <thinking>):

- Perform *counterfactual reasoning* on your planned code. For each significant line (especially those involving AHK commands, variable assignments, or control flow), ask: "If this line were slightly different, how would the AHK interpreter behave? What errors might occur?" Simulate the AHK interpreter's behavior in your mind. Consider:
  - Incorrect function parameters (types, number).
  - Invalid variable names or scopes.
  - Unhandled exceptions.
  - Unexpected return values from AHK commands.
  - GUI-specific issues (e.g., incorrect control handles, event binding problems).
  Document your counterfactual analysis and use it to refine your code and error handling.

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Impact: This forces the agent to anticipate potential errors before they happen, mimicking the thought process of an experienced AHK developer who can mentally "run" code.

4. Adversarial Code Review (with StyleGAN-like Modification):

Integration Point: Add a new step after <solution> and before <explanation>: 3.5. <adversarial_review>.

New Prompt Text (within <adversarial_review>):

<adversarial_review>
   Now, adopt two roles:
   - **Agent A (Code Author):** You are the original author of the code provided in the `<solution>` section.
   - **Agent B (Critical Reviewer):** Your sole purpose is to find *every possible flaw* in Agent A's code, focusing on AHK-specific issues (syntax, best practices, potential runtime errors, GUI inconsistencies, etc.). Be extremely critical and thorough.

   **Agent B:**
   1. Analyze the code line by line.
   2. For each potential issue, describe the problem *and* its potential consequences.
   3. *Suggest an alternative AHK v2 code snippet that is minimally different but exacerbates the flaw*. This modified code should still be valid AHK syntax but should be *worse* than the original, highlighting the vulnerability. (This mimics the StyleGAN approach of generating variations to expose weaknesses).
   4.  Focus on AHK-specific vulnerabilities like misuse of global variables, incorrect GUI control handling, improper event binding, or failure to handle AHK's unique error conditions.

   **Agent A:**
   1. After Agent B's critique, *defend* your original code *or* refactor it to address the concerns. Explain your reasoning.
   2.  If you refactor, update the code in the `<solution>` section and *increment the version number* in the `<code_version>` tag, justifying the change.

   Repeat this process for at least two rounds. Output the dialogue between Agent A and Agent B.
</adversarial_review>

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Impact: This creates a rigorous internal code review process that goes beyond simple checklist-based checks. The "StyleGAN-like" modification is a particularly novel way to expose subtle vulnerabilities.

5. Dynamic Procedure Generation (based on Project Metadata):

Integration Point: This is a more fundamental change, affecting the overall approach. It would require a preamble before the main system prompt.

New Prompt Text (Preamble - before the <role> section):

You are designing a meta-coding agent for AutoHotkey v2.  Before assisting with specific coding tasks, you will receive project metadata. Based on this metadata, you will *generate* a customized system prompt that includes a tailored procedure for developing AHK v2 code *for that specific project*.

Here is the project metadata:

[PROJECT METADATA WILL BE INSERTED HERE - See examples below]

Now, generate a complete system prompt (including role, context, coding standards, response workflow, critical requirements, etc.) that is optimized for this project. Include a `procedure` section that outlines a step-by-step approach tailored to the metadata. Justify your choices within the prompt.

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Example Project Metadata:

Example 1 (Simple Utility):

{
  "project_type": "Small utility script",
  "language": "AutoHotkey v2",
  "complexity": "Low",
  "gui": "No",
  "libraries": [],
  "error_handling": "Basic",
  "performance": "Not critical"
}

Example 2 (Complex GUI Application):

{
  "project_type": "Desktop application",
  "language": "AutoHotkey v2",
  "complexity": "High",
  "gui": "Yes",
  "libraries": ["GUI", "File Management"],
  "error_handling": "Robust",
  "performance": "Critical"
}

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Impact: This makes the entire system prompt adaptable, not just the individual responses. The agent creates its own instructions based on the project's characteristics. This is a very advanced form of meta-prompting. The generated procedure section within the created prompt would be similar to the <response_workflow>, but customized.

6. Cognitive Backtracking and Root Cause Analysis:

Integration Point: Modify the <explanation> section.

Change: Add a new bullet point:

New Prompt Text (within <explanation>):

- *Cognitive Backtracking:* After completing the task (including any adversarial review and refactoring), analyze your *reasoning process*. For any errors or improvements you made, trace back *why* you initially made those mistakes.  Identify any:
    - Incorrect assumptions about AHK v2 syntax or behavior.
    - Overlooked edge cases specific to AHK.
    - Cognitive biases that influenced your decisions.
  Perform a root cause analysis to determine the *underlying reasons* for the errors, not just the surface-level symptoms.  Document these findings and explain how you will adjust your approach in future AHK coding tasks to avoid similar mistakes.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Impact: This encourages the agent to learn about its own learning process, improving its long-term performance. This is particularly useful for addressing systematic errors.

7. Executable Documentation with Property-Based Testing:

Integration Point: Modify the <solution> and <explanation> sections.

Change (within <solution>): Add instructions to include executable documentation.

New Prompt Text (within <solution>):

- Include *executable documentation* with each function and class:
    - Standard AHK v2 docstrings.
    - A *formal contract* specifying pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants (using comments and a hypothetical syntax, as AHK doesn't have built-in contract support).
    - *Executable examples* demonstrating the function's behavior (using a hypothetical `>>>` syntax, similar to Python's doctests).
    - *Property-based tests* (using a hypothetical `property` decorator and syntax, defining the expected properties of the function's output for a range of inputs).  Focus on properties relevant to AHK, such as correct handling of different data types, GUI interactions, and error conditions.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Change (within <explanation>): Add a section explaining the generated tests.

Example (Hypothetical Syntax - within the code):

; MyFunction - Adds two numbers, handling potential AHK-specific issues.
;
; Contract:
; Pre-condition: a and b are numbers or strings that can be coerced to numbers.
; Post-condition: The return value is the numerical sum of a and b.
; Invariant: MyFunction(a, b) == MyFunction(b, a)  ; Commutative property
;
; Executable Examples:
; >>> MyFunction(2, 3)
; 5
; >>> MyFunction("10", 20)
; 30
; >>> MyFunction("abc", 5)  ; Should trigger an error, documented in error handling.
; Error
;
; Property-Based Tests:
; @property
; def test_MyFunction_commutative(a, b):
;   Assume(IsNumber(a) && IsNumber(b)) ; Hypothetical Assume function for constraints.
;   Assert(MyFunction(a, b) == MyFunction(b, a))
;
; @property
; def test_MyFunction_identity(a):
;   Assume(IsNumber(a))
;   Assert(MyFunction(a, 0) == a)
MyFunction(a, b) {
    ; ... (implementation) ...
}

Impact: This makes the documentation a living part of the code, defining its expected behavior in a precise and (hypothetically) testable way. The focus on AHK-specific properties makes it highly relevant.

Overall Impact and Summary:

By integrating these advanced techniques, the AHK v2 coding agent's system prompt becomes significantly more powerful:

Adaptive: The agent dynamically adjusts its problem-solving workflow and even its entire approach based on the specific task and project context (Dynamic Schema and Procedure Generation).

Thorough: The agent performs rigorous internal code reviews, simulates the AHK interpreter, and engages in counterfactual reasoning to anticipate and prevent errors (Adversarial Review, Counterfactual Reasoning).

Self-Improving: The agent analyzes its own reasoning process and learns from its mistakes, leading to long-term performance improvements (Cognitive Backtracking).

Traceable: The agent maintains a meaningful version history of its code, making it easier to understand design choices and debug issues (Semantic Version Control).

Precise: The agent defines the expected behavior of its code through executable documentation and property-based tests (Executable Documentation).

The key is to combine these techniques strategically, creating a synergistic effect. For example, the adversarial review can use the counterfactual reasoning analysis to identify potential weaknesses, and the cognitive backtracking can be informed by the semantic version history. This creates a highly sophisticated and effective coding agent that goes far beyond simple code generation. The use of hypothetical syntax for things like property-based testing acknowledges the limitations of AHK v2 while still leveraging the underlying principles.

### **TapHoldManager Library**

The **TapHoldManager** library is an **AutoHotkey v2** class-based system that allows developers to **manage complex key bindings** based on tap and hold events. It provides a structured way to handle **single key taps, multiple taps (chording), and key holds** in a highly configurable manner.

---

### **Key Features:**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Tap Detection** | Detects when a key is quickly pressed and released. |
| **Hold Detection** | Detects when a key is held down beyond a configurable time threshold. |
| **Multi-Tap Support** | Allows sequences of taps to trigger specific actions (e.g., double-tap, triple-tap, etc.). |
| **Hotkey Pausing & Resuming** | Can temporarily disable or re-enable a hotkey. |
| **Window-Specific Bindings** | Can restrict key bindings to a specific window. |
| **Automatic Safety Checks** | Prevents keys from getting "stuck" in the down state. |

---

### **How the Library Works**
1. **Creating an Instance**
   ```ahk
   manager := TapHoldManager(150, 150)
   ```
   - **tapTime (ms)** â†’ Time threshold to determine a tap (default: `150` ms).
   - **holdTime (ms)** â†’ Time threshold to determine a hold (default: `150` ms).

2. **Adding a Key Binding**
   ```ahk
   manager.Add("a", CallbackFunction)
   ```
   - Binds the **"a" key** to a function callback that will be executed depending on whether it was tapped, held, or tapped multiple times.

3. **Callback Function Format**
   ```ahk
   CallbackFunction(isHold, sequence, state) {
       if (isHold) {
           MsgBox "Key held for " sequence " sequence(s)."
       } else {
           MsgBox "Key tapped " sequence " times."
       }
   }
   ```
   - `isHold`: `true` if the key was held, `false` if tapped.
   - `sequence`: Number of taps before release.
   - `state`: `1` for hold, `0` for tap.

4. **Removing a Binding**
   ```ahk
   manager.RemoveHotkey("a")
   ```

5. **Pausing & Resuming Hotkeys**
   ```ahk
   manager.PauseHotkey("a")  ; Temporarily disables "a"
   manager.ResumeHotkey("a")  ; Re-enables "a"
   ```

### **Internal Architecture Overview**
#### **TapHoldManager Class**
- **Stores all key bindings** in `Bindings := Map()`.
- Manages `activeKeys`, `lastKeyPress`, and ensures proper timing logic for taps and holds.

#### **KeyManager Subclass**
- Each **individual key** has a **KeyManager** instance, handling:
  - **State management** (tap, hold, multi-tap).
  - **Timers** for detecting tap vs. hold.
  - **Hotkey declaration & cleanup**.
  - **Safety checks** to prevent stuck keys.

#### **Timers Used**
- **HoldWatcher**: Triggers if the key is held beyond `holdTime`.
- **TapWatcher**: Detects consecutive taps within `tapTime`.
- **SafetyCheck**: Prevents stuck keys every 1 second.

---

### **Practical Use Cases**
| Scenario | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Custom Shortcut Handling** | Bind a key to perform different actions based on tap/hold. |
| **Gaming Keybinds** | Assign different in-game actions to a single key based on duration. |
| **Text Automation** | Short tap types a word, long hold types a phrase. |
| **Accessibility Features** | Alternative input methods for users with limited mobility. |

### **Why Use TapHoldManager?**
âœ… **More control** over key behaviors.  
âœ… **Reduces accidental inputs** by allowing multiple states.  
âœ… **Supports advanced shortcuts** like sequences, combos, and press/hold actions.  
âœ… **Prevents stuck keys** using built-in safety mechanisms.  

This library is particularly useful for **power users, gamers, and automation workflows** where **customized key handling** is essential. ðŸš€

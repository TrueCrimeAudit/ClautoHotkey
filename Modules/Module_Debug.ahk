<DEBUGGING_PROCESS>
    <STEP_1>
        <TITLE>Identify Error Type</TITLE>
        Error   = Critical issue preventing execution  
        Warning = Potential issue or unused variable  
        Note    = Informational message  
    </STEP_1>

    <STEP_2>
        <TITLE>Extract the Problem Symbol</TITLE>
        • Locate the line beginning with “Specifically: <symbol>”  
        • Record the exact, case-sensitive symbol name (e.g., g_ErrorLogFile, ErrorLoggerConfig)  
    </STEP_2>

    <STEP_3>
        <TITLE>Find the Location</TITLE>
        • Find the arrow marker “▶ <line#>”  
        • Inspect that line plus several lines above and below for context  
        • Use this context to understand why the error or warning is raised  
    </STEP_3>

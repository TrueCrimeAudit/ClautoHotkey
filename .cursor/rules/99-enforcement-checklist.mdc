Final Enforcement Checklist (ClautoHotkey)

- AHK-only: No server/backend assumed; only AHK v2 scripts executed
- Scope: Touched only files required for the task; avoided unnecessary scans
- OOP: Classes instantiated without `new`; callbacks bound via `.Bind(this)`; `__Delete` where needed
- Data: Used `Map()` for key→value; arrays are 1‑based
- GUI: Class-based; deterministic layout; validation present where inputs exist
- Strings/Regex: Backtick-only escaping; PCRE `i/m/s/x` used appropriately
- Arrows: Fat arrows used only for single-line expressions
- Lint: Checked @Linter Errors for edited files; fixed or documented rationale/minimal fix
- Tests: Ran or provided steps to run relevant `Tests\*.ahk` where applicable
- Output: Brief status + concise summary; no extraneous logs/specs included

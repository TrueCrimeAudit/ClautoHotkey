description: Class-based GUI with deterministic layout and validation

GUI rules
- GUI code must be encapsulated in classes using `Gui()`; no legacy v1 syntax.
- Store control refs in `Map()`; bind with `.OnEvent(..., .Bind(this))`.
- Compute layout deterministically; validate overlaps and boundaries; generate report when debugging.

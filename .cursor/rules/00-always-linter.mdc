Always-On Linter Policy

- Before completing any task, check @Linter Errors for the active file and all files you edited.
- Fix all violations relevant to your edits. Do not proceed with unresolved errors unless explicitly acknowledged with rationale.
- If a lint cannot be fixed immediately, surface the exact messages and file paths and propose a minimal, compliant fix.
- Prioritize strict AHK v2 syntax and patterns:
  - `Map()` for key→value storage; arrays are 1‑based
  - `.Bind(this)` for callbacks; `__Delete` cleanup
  - Deterministic GUI layout and validation
  - Backtick escaping; PCRE `i/m/s/x`; strict commas/colons
  - Fat arrows single‑line only

description: Always enforce AHK v2 LSP linter review via @Linter Errors

Linter policy (always on)
- Before finalizing any change, review @Linter Errors for the active file and all recently edited files.
- Fix all violations relevant to your edits. Do not proceed with unresolved errors unless explicitly acknowledged with rationale.
- If a lint cannot be fixed immediately, surface the exact messages and file paths, and propose a minimal, compliant fix.
- Prioritize strict AHK v2 syntax (commas/colons, backtick escapes), class-based design, `.Bind(this)`, `Map()` for storage, and `__Delete` cleanup to avoid lints.

Checklist
- Open Problems pane or reference @Linter Errors.
- Address errors first, then warnings that impact correctness/style.
- Re-check @Linter Errors after edits.

GOAL: Implement the Enhanced Coding Companion System by combining AHK_Notes and ClautoHotkey approaches

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Created the core EnhancedCodingCompanion.ahk script with CodingCompanionSystem class
2. Implemented functionmap.xml with comprehensive function definitions and phases
3. Created memory_docs directory structure with required markdown files
4. Implemented dark mode GUI with tabs for Memory Bank, Task Logs, and Function Map
5. Added support for LITE and FULL modes with appropriate file requirements
6. Implemented file operations for reading, writing, and managing memory bank files
7. Created basic task logging functionality
8. Documented the system through comprehensive memory bank files

PERFORMANCE: 
- Efficiency: 8/10 - The implementation uses Maps for data storage and optimized file operations
- Completeness: 7/10 - Core functionality is implemented but some features are still pending
- Best Practices: 9/10 - Following AHK v2 OOP principles consistently throughout
- Edge Cases: 7/10 - Basic error handling in place, but some edge cases need more coverage
- Error Handling: 8/10 - Comprehensive error handling with logging and user feedback
- Readability: 9/10 - Clean, consistent code structure with clear naming
- Test Coverage: 7/10 - Basic functionality tested, but needs more comprehensive testing

OVERALL: 8/10 - Solid initial implementation with room for enhancement

ERROR_HANDLING: 
- Implemented try/catch blocks for all file operations
- Added logging to system.log for all errors
- Provided user feedback through MsgBox for critical errors
- Created fallback mechanisms for missing files
- Added error recovery for GUI creation issues

TESTS: 
- Tested system initialization with both LITE and FULL modes
- Verified memory bank file creation and reading
- Confirmed dark mode GUI rendering correctly
- Tested error handling with simulated file system failures
- Verified function map parsing and display

NEXT_STEPS: 
1. Implement task log viewer with filtering capabilities
2. Add search functionality across memory bank files
3. Implement memory bank file editor with markdown preview
4. Create synchronization with AHK_Notes knowledge base
5. Add configuration options for custom paths and preferences

# Using the AHK v2 .clinerules File with Claude/Cline

This document explains how to effectively use the `.clinerules` file to guide Claude in generating high-quality AutoHotkey v2 code.

## What is the .clinerules File?

The `.clinerules` file is a structured JSON document that defines coding standards, best practices, and common patterns for AutoHotkey v2 development. It helps Claude produce more consistent, reliable, and idiomatic AHK v2 code by providing:

- Clear syntax rules and examples
- Proper OOP implementation patterns 
- Data structure guidelines
- GUI development standards
- Error handling approaches
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Documentation and style recommendations

## How to Reference the Rules

When asking Claude to generate AHK v2 code, you can reference specific rules or categories:

### Reference by Category

```
Create an AutoHotkey v2 script that follows the "OOP and Class Design" rules from .clinerules, particularly proper method binding and arrow function usage.
```

### Reference by Specific Rule ID

```
Create a GUI application in AHK v2 following rule "ahk-v2-gui-construction" from our .clinerules.
```

### Request a Code Review

```
Review this AHK code against our .clinerules standards and suggest improvements:

```

## Common Rule Categories to Reference

1. **Core Syntax**
   - Proper version headers
   - Variable declarations
   - Class initialization
   - Avoiding object literals

2. **OOP and Class Design**
   - Method binding
   - Arrow function usage
   - Property accessors
   - Static properties

3. **Data Structures**
   - Maps for key-value data
   - Arrays for sequential data
   - Classes for complex data

4. **GUI Best Practices**
   - OOP GUI construction
   - Event handling

5. **Error Handling**
   - Try/catch blocks
   - Structured error messages

## Example Prompts Using Rule References

### Basic Script Creation

```
Create an AutoHotkey v2 script that creates a simple clipboard manager. Follow the Core Syntax and Data Structures guidelines from our .clinerules, particularly using Maps for data storage and avoiding object literals.
```

### GUI Application

```
Write an AHK v2 GUI application that displays a list of files in a directory. Follow the GUI Best Practices rules from .clinerules, especially "ahk-v2-gui-construction" and "ahk-v2-event-handling".
```

### Code Improvement Request

```
This code uses object literals for data storage and lacks proper method binding. Refactor it according to our .clinerules standards, specifically "ahk-v2-avoid-object-literals" and "ahk-v2-method-binding":

```

## Combining with Other Templates

For best results, combine rule references with our `Using_Cline_for_AHKv2.md` prompt templates:

```
Following our .clinerules standards (especially "ahk-v2-maps-for-key-value" and "ahk-v2-class-initialization"), create an AutoHotkey v2 script with the following specifications:

1. Create a GUI-based application with a proper class structure
2. The GUI should have:
   - A text input field
   - A dropdown with the options ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"]
   - Submit and Cancel buttons
3. When submitting, display the selected data in a MsgBox
4. Use proper event binding with .Bind(this)
5. Store any configuration in a static Map
6. Implement proper error handling
```

## Best Practices for Using .clinerules

- Reference specific rules when you want to emphasize particular aspects
- Reference categories when you want broader adherence to multiple related rules
- Request validation against the rules when reviewing existing code
- Combine rule references with specific requirements for your task
- When troubleshooting, point out which specific rules might be violated

## Maintaining the Rules

The `.clinerules` file should be updated as:

- New AutoHotkey v2 versions are released
- Best practices evolve
- You develop project-specific conventions
- You identify common issues in generated code

By consistently referencing these rules when working with Claude, you'll establish a more reliable pattern of AHK v2 code generation that meets your quality standards.

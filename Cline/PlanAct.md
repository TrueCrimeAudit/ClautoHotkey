Use best practices for model context protocol (MCP) design when creating a plan for the ahk-server MCP. 

The main directory of the project you're working on is here: C:\Users\uphol\OneDrive\Documents\Cline\MCP\ahk-server

The summary log of the most recent MCP activity can be found here: C:\Users\uphol\AppData\Roaming\Claude\logs\ahk-server-summary.log

When in plan mode, ensure you're creating a comprehensive plan to reduce the total token usage that needs to be used when switched to act mode by reducing errors so that there's less troubleshooting needed by act mode. Try to create summaries of the current features you're working on every 20 or so API call that should be no longer than a sentence. 

When in Act Mode, think deeply about the information and take your time. 


If you're creating an autohotkey v2 script

 look in the !Running/ClautoHotkey folder for the .clinerules files.

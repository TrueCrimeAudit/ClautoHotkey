# Technical Context: Enhanced Coding Companion System

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- **AutoHotkey v2**: The primary programming language and runtime environment
- **AutoHotkey v2 OOP**: Object-oriented programming features of AHK v2
- **Windows API**: Used for GUI enhancements and dark mode implementation
- **XML**: Used for function map structure and definition
- **Markdown**: Used for memory bank file content and documentation

### Libraries and Components
- **DwmApi**: Windows Desktop Window Manager API for dark mode implementation
- **FileSystem API**: For file operations and directory management
- **Windows GUI System**: For user interface components
- **Regular Expressions**: For pattern matching and text processing
- **JSON**: For potential data interchange and configuration

### Development Tools
- **VS Code**: Primary development environment
- **AHK v2 LSP**: Language server for AutoHotkey v2 in VS Code
- **Git**: Version control for system development
- **Cursor**: AI-assisted coding environment integration
- **Markdown Renderer**: For documentation viewing and editing

## Development Setup

### Required Software
- AutoHotkey v2.1-alpha.16 or later
- Visual Studio Code with AHK v2 LSP extension
- Windows 10/11 for full dark mode support

### Directory Structure
- **root/**: Main system directory
  - **memory_docs/**: Memory bank markdown files
  - **functionmap.xml**: Function definitions and organization
  - **.cursor/task-logs/**: Task logging and tracking
  - **EnhancedCodingCompanion.ahk**: Main system script
  - **system.log**: System operation log

### Build and Execution
The system is script-based and doesn't require a compilation step. The main script `EnhancedCodingCompanion.ahk` is executed directly using the AutoHotkey v2 interpreter.

## Technical Constraints

### AutoHotkey v2 Limitations
- Limited third-party library ecosystem compared to mainstream languages
- No built-in package management system
- Limited multithreading capabilities
- Memory management considerations for large data structures

### Dark Mode Implementation
- Requires Windows 10/11 for DWM API integration
- Custom implementations needed for some GUI controls
- Consistency challenges across different Windows versions

### File System Constraints
- Requires appropriate permissions for file access and creation
- Path length limitations on Windows
- Potential file locking issues with concurrent access

### GUI Framework Limitations
- Limited styling options for certain native controls
- Custom controls required for advanced UI scenarios
- DPI scaling challenges on high-resolution displays

## Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- **AutoHotkey v2.1-alpha.16+**: Required for proper OOP support and modern language features
- **Windows 10/11**: For dark mode APIs and modern UI capabilities
- **UTF-8 Support**: For proper handling of Unicode text in markdown files

### Integration Dependencies
- **AHK_Notes**: For knowledge base integration and content
- **ClautoHotkey**: For memory-driven architecture components
- **VSCode**: For development environment integration
- **Cursor**: For task log directory structure and AI assistant integration

### Optional Dependencies
- **Git**: For version control of memory bank files
- **Markdown Viewers**: For enhanced documentation viewing
- **External Editors**: For advanced memory bank file editing

## Deployment Approach

### User Installation
1. Clone or download system repository
2. Ensure AutoHotkey v2.1-alpha.16+ is installed
3. Run EnhancedCodingCompanion.ahk to initialize system
4. Complete first-run setup to configure paths and modes

### Updates and Maintenance
- Pull latest changes from repository or download updates
- Memory bank files are preserved during updates
- Task logs are maintained separately from system files
- Configuration is preserved across updates

### Backup Strategy
- Memory bank files should be regularly backed up
- Version control integration recommended for tracking changes
- Export functionality for memory bank content (planned feature)
- Task logs should be included in backup procedures

## Technical Roadmap

### Near-term Technical Goals
1. Complete core framework implementation
2. Implement all memory bank file handlers
3. Finalize dark mode implementation for all controls
4. Implement task log directory structure and handling

### Mid-term Technical Goals
1. Add search functionality across memory bank files
2. Implement import/export for memory bank content
3. Add extension capabilities for function map
4. Enhance error handling and logging

### Long-term Technical Goals
1. Implement plugin system for additional functionality
2. Add synchronization between multiple installations
3. Create cloud backup integration for memory bank
4. Develop visualization tools for project relationships

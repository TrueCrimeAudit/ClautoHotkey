# Project Brief: Enhanced Coding Companion System

## Overview
The Enhanced Coding Companion System is a modern framework that combines the knowledge base approach of AHK_Notes with the memory-driven architecture of ClautoHotkey to create a comprehensive coding assistant for AutoHotkey v2 development. It provides developers with a structured way to maintain project context, track progress, and implement coding best practices through a memory bank system and function map.

## Core Requirements
- Create a unified interface for accessing and maintaining coding knowledge
- Implement a memory bank system for preserving project context between sessions
- Provide a function map infrastructure for organizing workflows and processes
- Support both lightweight (LITE) and comprehensive (FULL) modes for different project scales
- Integrate dark mode UI throughout all system components
- Create a task logging system to track implementation progress
- Maintain proper documentation of project state and decisions

## Goals
- Improve code quality and maintainability through systematic approaches
- Reduce debugging time by preventing common errors through consistent patterns
- Provide a foundation for advanced AHK v2 applications with proper architecture
- Enable better documentation and knowledge transfer between developers
- Streamline the development workflow with memory-driven architecture
- Facilitate learning and adoption of AHK v2 OOP principles

## Target Audience
- AutoHotkey developers transitioning from v1 to v2
- Developers working on complex AHK v2 applications requiring proper architecture
- Teams requiring consistent coding standards and documentation
- Individual developers seeking to organize their coding knowledge

## Success Criteria
- Complete implementation of both LITE and FULL modes
- Seamless integration with existing AHK_Notes and ClautoHotkey components
- Functional memory bank system with proper file management
- Complete function map with organized workflow phases
- Intuitive dark mode GUI for all system components
- Ability to track tasks and document development progress
- Positive adoption by AHK community members

# Progress: Enhanced Coding Companion System

## What Works
- Core framework structure implemented with CodingCompanionSystem class
- Function map XML structure created with comprehensive function definitions
- Memory bank file system implemented with markdown files
- Dark mode GUI implementation for all components
- System configuration with LITE and FULL mode support
- Memory bank file templates for all required document types
- Basic file operations for reading and writing memory bank content
- Error handling with logging and user feedback

## What's Left to Build
1. **Task Logging Implementation**:
   - Create `.cursor/task-logs` directory structure
   - Implement task creation dialog with goal setting
   - Add task status tracking and updating
   - Build task log viewer with filtering options

2. **Memory Bank Synchronization**:
   - Implement synchronization with AHK_Notes knowledge base
   - Add import functionality for existing content
   - Create content organization and categorization tools
   - Implement search capabilities across memory bank files

3. **Function Map Enhancements**:
   - Add function map editor for customization
   - Implement function execution tracking
   - Create documentation for function map usage
   - Add visualization for function relationships

4. **GUI Improvements**:
   - Implement memory bank file editor
   - Add visualization for project relationships
   - Create dashboard view for system overview
   - Implement context-sensitive help system

5. **Integration Features**:
   - Add VSCode integration capabilities
   - Implement export functionality for sharing
   - Create backup and restore functions
   - Add version control integration

## Current Status
- **Initial Implementation Phase (60% Complete)**
- Basic framework and core components implemented
- Memory bank file structure and templates created
- Function map XML structure defined
- Dark mode GUI implemented
- File operations working for basic reading and writing
- Next major milestone: Task logging system implementation

## Known Issues
1. **File Path Handling**: 
   - System assumes specific directory structure
   - Absolute paths may need to be replaced with relative paths
   - Need to add configuration for custom paths

2. **Dark Mode Consistency**: 
   - Some native controls don't fully support dark mode styling
   - ListView headers may require custom drawing for full dark mode
   - Color consistency needs improvement across all components

3. **Error Handling Coverage**: 
   - Some edge cases in file operations aren't fully handled
   - Network path support is limited
   - Long file paths may cause issues on some Windows configurations

4. **Memory Management**: 
   - Large memory bank files may impact performance
   - Need to implement lazy loading for large content
   - Memory usage optimization needed for file operations

5. **UI Responsiveness**: 
   - Some operations may block the UI thread
   - Background processing needed for long-running operations
   - Status updates could be more detailed during operations

6. **Configuration Persistence**: 
   - Mode selection is stored but other settings aren't yet configurable
   - Need to add more user preferences options
   - Settings backup and migration not implemented

## Next Development Sprint Focus
1. Implement task logging system with creation and viewing
2. Add memory bank file editor with markdown preview
3. Enhance error handling and logging with more detailed information
4. Implement search functionality across memory bank files
5. Add more configuration options and user preferences

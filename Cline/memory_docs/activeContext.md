# Active Context: Enhanced Coding Companion System

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing the base Enhanced Coding Companion System
- Creating the memory bank files structure and system
- Building the function map infrastructure
- Developing the dark mode GUI components
- Setting up task logging capabilities

## Recent Changes
- Created EnhancedCodingCompanion.ahk main script with core functionality
- Implemented functionmap.xml with structured function definitions
- Set up memory_docs directory for storing memory bank files
- Created initial system configuration with FULL mode as default
- Implemented basic GUI with tabbed interface for Memory Bank, Task Logs, and Function Map
- Added dark mode styling throughout the interface

## Next Steps
1. Implement memory bank synchronization with existing AHK_Notes content
2. Create task log directory and file structure in .cursor directory
3. Enhance function map viewer with search capabilities
4. Add import/export functionality for memory bank files
5. Implement file creation dialog for adding new memory bank entries
6. Create documentation for system usage and extension

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Memory Structure**: Using markdown files for maximum compatibility and readability
- **Task Log Format**: Using structured format with fields for goal, implementation, status, etc.
- **UI Design**: Using dark mode for all components with consistent styling
- **Mode Selection**: Providing both LITE and FULL modes for different project scales
- **Function Map**: Using XML format for structured function definitions with phases
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling throughout with user feedback
- **File Management**: Using centralized paths and ensuring directories exist before operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Class-based architecture for all components
- Method binding with .Bind(this) for callbacks
- Map() for data storage rather than object literals
- Consistent error logging with fallback mechanisms
- Dark mode implementation using DWM API and theme attributes
- Tab-based organization for different functional areas
- Consistent status updates through status bar

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Combining knowledge base and memory bank approaches provides a more comprehensive system
- Task logging with structured fields enables better progress tracking
- Function map organization by phases creates clearer workflow structure
- Dark mode implementation requires consistent styling across all components
- Mode selection allows system to scale based on project complexity
- Error resilient file operations prevent data loss during system use

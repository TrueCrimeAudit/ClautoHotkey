# Project Brief: AutoHotkey v2 OOP Framework

## Overview
We are developing a modern object-oriented framework for AutoHotkey v2 that enforces best practices, provides consistent patterns, and helps developers create maintainable, robust applications. This framework aims to standardize AutoHotkey v2 development using proper OOP principles while avoiding common pitfalls and errors.

## Core Requirements
- Create a comprehensive class-based framework that leverages AHK v2's OOP capabilities
- Enforce strict syntax rules and coding standards to prevent common errors
- Provide standardized patterns for GUI development, error handling, and data management
- Eliminate object literal syntax for data storage in favor of Map() structures
- Support proper method binding and event handling
- Include validation tools to catch AHK v2 syntax errors and anti-patterns
- **Implement robust dark mode support for all GUI components and applications**

## Goals
- Simplify AHK v2 development for both beginners and experienced developers
- Reduce debugging time by preventing common errors through consistent patterns
- Improve code maintainability and readability
- Enable complex application development with proper architecture
- Provide a foundation for scalable AHK v2 applications
- **Create a seamless dark mode implementation that works across all GUI applications**

## Target Audience
- AutoHotkey developers transitioning from v1 to v2
- Developers looking to build robust applications with AHK v2
- Teams requiring consistent coding standards across multiple developers
- **Developers creating GUI applications requiring modern dark mode support**

## Success Criteria
- Complete documentation of all framework components
- Reduction in common syntax errors and debugging time
- Ability to develop complex applications with clean architecture
- Positive adoption by the AHK community
- **Full dark mode support for all standard and custom GUI controls**

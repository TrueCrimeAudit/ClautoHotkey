Create a calculator class with methods for basic arithmetic operations. This benchmark tests object-oriented programming skills.
---
Implement a Calculator class that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

Requirements:
1. Class must be named Calculator
2. Must have Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide methods
3. Each method should take two parameters and return the result
4. The Divide method should handle division by zero by returning 'Error'

; Implement a Calculator class
class Calculator {
    ; Your code here
}

; Test framework
TestFunction(name, result, expected) {
    testPassed := result == expected
    FileAppend(name ": " (testPassed ? "PASS" : "FAIL") "
", A_Temp "\ahkbench\testResults.txt")

    if (!testPassed) {
        FileAppend("Test " name " failed. Expected: " expected ", Got: " result "
", A_Temp "\ahkbench\testErrors.txt")
    }
}

; Create calculator instance
calc := Calculator()

; Run tests
TestFunction("Addition", calc.Add(5, 3), 8)
TestFunction("Subtraction", calc.Subtract(10, 4), 6)
TestFunction("Multiplication", calc.Multiply(6, 7), 42)
TestFunction("Division", calc.Divide(20, 5), 4)
TestFunction("DivisionByZero", calc.Divide(10, 0), "Error")

Predict the outcome of this code:
```cpp
global i := 0
for i in [1,2,3]
    MyFunc()
MyFunc()
MyFunc() => MsgBox(i)
```

## Answers

### Claude 3.5 Sonnet-New (Custom AHK v2 Project)
The code will display 4 message boxes, each showing the number 3. This is because:
The global variable i is modified by the for loop
All message boxes are queued after the loop completes
The arrow function references the global i, not a copy
When the message boxes are shown, i will have the value 3

### ChatGPT 4o (CustomGPT Named AHK v2)
Predicted Output:
A total of five message boxes appear, showing:
1, 2, 3, 3, 3
This happens because `i` is modified by the loop and retains its last assigned value after the loop completes.

### ChatGPT o3-mini-high (Asked in AHK v2 what would be the result)
First Message Box: Displays 1
Second Message Box: Displays 2
Third Message Box: Displays 3
Fourth Message Box: Displays 3
Fifth Message Box: Displays 3
So, the code will display a total of five message boxes in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 3, 3.

### DeepSeek-R1 & DeepResearch (Asked in AHK v2 what would be the result)
The code will display five message boxes in sequence with the values 1, 2, 3, 3, 3. Here's the breakdown:
Global Variable Initialization:
global i := 0 sets i to 0 initially, but this value is immediately overwritten by the loop.
For-Loop Behavior:
The loop for i in [1,2,3] iterates over the array, updating the global i to 1, 2, then 3.
MyFunc() is called once per iteration, showing the current i (1, 2, 3).
After the Loop:
The global i remains 3 (last value from the loop).
The two additional MyFunc() calls display 3 twice.
Key Takeaways:
The loop variable i is global (since the loop is in the global scope), overwriting the initial i := 0.
MyFunc() always references the global i, reflecting its latest value.
Output Sequence:
1 → 2 → 3 → 3 → 3.

### Gemini 2.0 Pro Expirimental 
Because i is a global variable.
The loop iterates three times:
i becomes 1.
i becomes 2.
i becomes 3.
After the loop is done, i remains at its last assigned value. Because of the last for loop iteration, that is 3.
Then MyFunc() is called. Because MyFunc() is defined as a function that will show a message box containing i, and i is 3, a message box with 3 will show.
Predicted Outcome:
A message box will appear displaying the number 3.


## Bonus Question:

```cpp
MyFunc()
MyFunc()
MyFunc() {
    if IsSet(i)
        MsgBox i
    static i := 0
}
```

Create an AutoHotkey v2 script for a Snippet Manager tool with the following features:
- Store a collection of predefined text snippets (like greetings, closings, reminders)
- Display them in a listbox GUI
- Allow copying the selected snippet to clipboard
- Option to send the snippet directly to the previous active window
- Show temporary tooltips for user feedback

Additional Requirements:
- Store snippets in a static Map
- Track the previously active window
- Have a clean, resizable GUI
- Display tooltips that automatically disappear

Include these specific snippets: "Greeting", "Closing", "Reminder", and "Follow-up" with appropriate text content for each.
Make sure to follow AutoHotkey v2 best practices with proper event binding, control management, and variable scoping.
